tabplate (tablet template)
======

tabplate is a blank slate template for tablet-focused web projects.

tabplate is not fluid or responsive.

tabplate provides the bare bones for a web page or, more likely, web app that is primarily focused on the tablet interface.

tabplate is designed with the iPad in mind, but should work for a variety of tablets.
